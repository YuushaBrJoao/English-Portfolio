      <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Since a young age, Iâ€™ve had a deep interest in technology and games, which led me to begin my professional journey at age 16 in the IT department of a company. Even in an entry-level role, I developed skills that allowed me to perform tasks typically handled by more experienced professionals. Over time, I strengthened my technical foundation and chose to pursue academic development by enrolling in a Game Design college. 
        <br><br>
        During college, I took part in a Game Jam that awakened a strong interest in the world of Game Development. Shortly after, I got an internship in the field, which contributed significantly to my growthâ€”even though the project was not completed as expected. After graduation, I worked at an Augmented Reality company where I participated in project presentations and prototypes for major clients.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I work as a programming and robotics instructor. This role has reignited my passion for education and opened opportunities to expand my knowledge in various game development tools and logic structures. I'm always eager to learn and grow in the creative and dynamic world of games.
